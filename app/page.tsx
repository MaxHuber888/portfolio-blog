        Hi, my name is Maximilian Huber. I am a software engineer with a strong
        interest in AI and healthcare technology. However, I am also interested
        in exploring diverse and creative fields, including game development,
        data science, and design.

          (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to answer user's questions about
          trading cards through the CollX app. I also learned some data science
          and data engineering skills, creating useful KPI dashboards with SQL

        I am now pursuing a Masterâ€™s Degree in Artificial Intelligence at
        Northeastern University. I am mainly focusing on courses in computer
        vision, deep learning, and reinforcement learning, though I am also
        interested in exploring HCI and how it relates to AI. I am currently

        at Northeastern, doing computational neuroscience research involving
        graph theory and reinforcement learning. This work is motivated by two
        goals of mine: to improve my understanding of complex AI architectures
        and topics, and to expose myself to emerging AI applications in
        healthcare. Also in pursuit of these goals, I am working as the lead TA
        for an AI in Health course at NEU.

        Throughout my time at NEU, I have also worked on dozens of software and
        design projects, for personal, academic, and industry use, in a variety
