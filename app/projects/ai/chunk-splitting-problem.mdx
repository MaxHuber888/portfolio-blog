This was my final project for my NLP class, but I had started working on it months before the class started. I tested three existing indexing methods: Rule-Based Chunking, Semantic Chunking, and Slide Retrieval. Additionally, I designed a fourth experimental method, Neural Network Estimation Retrieval (NNER), for indexing a text corpus. NNER uses a neural network (PyTorch) to create a linear representation of a corpus, and learns to extract information from a specific location of the corpus regardless of how it is broken into chunks, which overcomes the chunk splitting problem and saving on embedding costs.

Unfortunately, in my testing the NNER method severely underperformed, which could be due to a wide range of factors (listed in the attached report). I am currently not interested in continuing this project, although I still believe that with the proper adjustments NNER could be a viable alternative.

## Motivations:

I had become aware of the "chunk splitting problem" while working on an RAG system for my co-op, and I wanted to experiment with an idea I had for a new indexing method which I believed had potential to circumvent this problem. This project was a way for me to apply what I learned about RAG on my co-op, while also exercising my creative spirit by trying to innovate in the RAG space.

## Process:

I made the repo for this project clean and extendable, in case I wanted to add new indexing methods, and to make it easier to test them fairly against each other. There is still more I want to do with this project but I have already spent a lot of time on it and I still don't know if NNER will actually work.
