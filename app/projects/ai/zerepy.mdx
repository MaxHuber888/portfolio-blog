ZerePy is an open-source Python framework designed to let you deploy your own agents on X (formerly Twitter), powered by OpenAI or Anthropic LLMs.

ZerePy is built from a modularized version of the Zerebro backend. With ZerePy, you can launch your own agent with similar core functionality as Zerebro. For creative outputs, you'll need to fine-tune your own model.

This project was created in collaboration with the <a href="https://www.parallelpolis.llc" className="dark:hover:text-neutral-400">Parallel Polis</a> research group and the <a href="https://zerebro.org" className="dark:hover:text-neutral-400">Zerebro</a> team.

## Motivations:
I was excited to work on this project because I did not have any open-source project experience and I wanted to explore what was possible with LLM-powered agents.

While there were other people working on this, and a lot of functionality came through open-source contributions, I designed the original structure and the autonomous task graph.

## Implementation:
This framework is built with Python.

## Future Work:
Future work can be found on the repo itself in the form of issues and feature requests.
