DeepSquid is a custom deepfake detection RNN designed to help users identify fake YouTube videos. Integrated with a Gradio web demo, DeepSquid allows users to simply paste in a YouTube URL to detect potential deepfakes. Training was done on the <a href="https://www.zerofox.com/deepstar-open-source-toolkit/" className="dark:hover:text-neutral-400">Deepstar</a> dataset of real and deepfaked YouTube videos. We saw promising results during testing, as the RNN model surpassed the Deepstar example models in training and validation accuracy.

## Motivations:

I was enthusiastic to do this project because the popularization of generative AI has made separating what is real and what is fake online much more difficult. I think this confusion can have serious real world implications, and I wanted to gain some experience in detecting AI-generated artifacts. This project was also my first time using TensorFlow and Keras, all my previous neural network projects have been in PyTorch.
