Harmonolith is a top-down co-op RPG game that I started working on with a friend in early 2024. We started with a concept for the world of the game, as we are both fans of the sci-fi genre, and our guiding principle for this game is just to make it as fun to play with friends as possible.

## Motivations:
Our main motivation for starting this project was that both me and my friend enjoy creating things for other people to enjoy. We wanted to make a game that our friends would enjoy playing with us. We also wanted to challenge ourselves by incorporating online multiplayer functionality.

## Implementation:
The game is built using Godot engine (using GDScript), and we are using a Blender workflow to create some of the sprites. So far the most challenging element has been implementing online multiplayer, which was expected.

## Future Work:
- Create attack animations
- Implement player and enemy death
- Create a simple arena mode
