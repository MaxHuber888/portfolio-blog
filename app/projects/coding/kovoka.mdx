This application allows users to create, collect, and listen to guided meditations. There are generative AI tools to help with generating transcripts and generating voiceovers. There is an explore page which allows users to browse meditations published by others. There is also a collection page which allows users to browse all of their own meditations and any they've favorited. The app allows users to set up notifications to help them stay on track with their meditation practice, and allows them to change the theme of the app to better suit their preferences.

## Motivations:
This project was a capstone assignment for my Mobile App Development course. I love meditation and I think that guided meditations are a great way to get started with a meditation practice. I also think that generative AI tools have a lot of potential to help with creating guided meditations.

## Implementation:
This application was written in Java and uses the Android SDK. I used the OpenAI API for the generative AI tools (transcript generation and voice generation). User authentication and data storage was implemented using Firebase.

## Future Work:
- Fix a few minor bugs
- Fix the sound quality of the voiceovers
- Make the notification system more robust and intuitive
