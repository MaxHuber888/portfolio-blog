This application allows users to come together and create collaborative artwork in real-time, with various brushes, colors, and filters available. The networking functionality is mostly implemented from scratch.

## Links:

## Motivations:
This project was a capstone assignment for a graduate Software Engineering course I took in the spring of 2024.

## Implementation:
This application was written in the D programming language (also known as DLang) and uses the SDL2 library for rendering graphics.

## Future Work:
- Fix a few minor bugs
- Write clearer instructions for installation
- Package as an executable
