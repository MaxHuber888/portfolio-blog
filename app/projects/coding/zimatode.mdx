This is a Python program which allows you to generate and render a simulation that dynamically reacts to any audio file. This is part of a more ambitious project to create a software which allows users to easily create music visualizers. Currently there are 4 supported simulation types: a spring-based visualizer, a particle-based visualizer, a pressure-grid-based visualizer, and a branching visualizer.

## Motivations:
I want to build this program out into a tool which allows anyone to create a visualizer for their music very easily. I am also enjoying learning about fluid and hard-body physics simulations, fractals, and audio analysis through this project.

## Implementation:
This application was written in Python and uses [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/) to create the simulations and [librosa](https://librosa.org/) to handle the audio analysis.

## Future Work:
- Fixing the branching and grid simulations to work as intended
- Fixing the multi-frequency impulses
- Adding multi-frequency capabilities to all simulations
