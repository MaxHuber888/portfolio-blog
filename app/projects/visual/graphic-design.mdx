This is a gallery of everything notable that I made for my Graphic Design courses at Northeastern University.

## Graphic Design 1

![Egg Beater Ink Sketch](https://res.cloudinary.com/dadbbieca/image/upload/v1724207311/FullSizeRender_-_Copy_14_um1on5.jpg)

This is a sketch I made of my chosen egg beater using a bamboo skewer. The skewer is very difficult to use to make straight, even
lines, so embracing the imperfections of the sketch was a mandatory step of the process.

To further familiarize ourselves with our chosen egg beater, we were tasked with creating a photo series. This forced us
to really observe the details and "movements" of our chosen egg beaters.

I am not really a photographer, but I think some of these pictures came out really beautifully.

I remember that this last photo struck me as having a surprising emotional clarity. The bright, empty space of the background
creates a real sense of loneliness and being stranded.

Our first "real" design project was using cut pieces of paper to make "abstractions" of our egg beaters. Some of these
had specific prompts to follow (I included them with each picture below), and some were meant to be entirely abstract.

"End Times" - (abstract)

This one is my favorite of the series.

Our next project built upon the last one. We had to print out pictures of our cut-paper abstractions, and cut squares out
of them to create a sequence. This tested our ability to be creative and aesthetic in a subtractive process, while also
challenging us to tell a story without words and characters.

Here is the final sequence. Can you follow the flow of the story?

In addition to all the projects focusing on the egg beaters, we also worked on projects which revolved around chairs. We
were randomly assigned two chairs designed by famous designers to research and work with. The chairs assigned to me were
the Breuer Armchair and the Pesce Umbrella chair.

I felt that the two chairs had very complimentary silhouettes, and I focused on shifts in scale in my initial sketches.

It took a lot of experimentation, but I eventually arrived at a final poster design that I really liked. The poster had
to promote an imaginary lecture series at RIT.

## Graphic Design 2

For this class, instead of having multiple projects, we were working on creating a social campaign. My social campaign was focused around improving drug education and mitigating drug addiction and substance abuse.
