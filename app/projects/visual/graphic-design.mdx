This is a gallery of everything notable that I made for my graphic design courses at Northeastern University, as well as assorted freelance projects.

## Graphic Design 1 Classwork
This class was focused on learning the basics of graphic design, with a strong focus on contrast, layout, and iteration.

## Graphic Design 2 Classwork
In this class, we were tasked with designing a social campaign. My campaign was focused on improving drug education and mitigating substance abuse by promoting an educational mobile app called Pharmazen.

        I ended up creating a whole brand language for the app, including a logo, color palette, and typography.
